ðŸ“˜ Description
Recursion is a problem-solving technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller parts of the problem.

ðŸ”‘ Topics Covered
Writing recursive methods

Understanding base case vs. recursive case

Common recursive patterns: factorial, sum, Fibonacci

Tracing and debugging recursive calls

```java
// Recursive method to compute factorial
public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1; // Base case
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call
}

System.out.println(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```
