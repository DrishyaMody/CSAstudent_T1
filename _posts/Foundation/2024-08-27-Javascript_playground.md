**Cookie Clicker Design**


<img src="/CSAstudent_T1/images/cookieClickerplan.png" alt="My Interests" height="400" width="600">


**Calculator plan**
- to earn the 100% hack we plan to add the 3 operators: exponent, remainder, division
- we also want to inclue the concept of calculator history, (maybe via localStorage?)

**Snake Plan**
-  make grid to fix the bug where the screen moves up and down with the arrow keys.
- add powerups, (extra speed, revive object when captured has to answer a question to attain powerup)
